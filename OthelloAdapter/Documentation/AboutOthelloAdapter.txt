What is OthelloAdapter

OthelloAdapter allows a layer of abstraction between different version clients of Othello and different version
of Othello library. This allows re-use of the Othello library without further testing (only the adapter is solely responsible for breaks)

In the future, we can just use an adapter to deal with different version clients without having to re-test the Othello library without it.
