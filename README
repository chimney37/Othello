About: 
This is an othello game as a personal side project for educational purposes. 
I made this because during university CS course more than 14 years ago,I had a bad attempt at an AI project and I flunked it badly :) 
This project is a total re-work (though a totally different game I was told to work on).

Game Features:
Features are 1 Player versus 1 Player, 1 Player versus A.I. There are Save and Load, Undo and Redo. 
It features a Game engine A.I module with adjustable difficulty. It uses WPF as the client GUI.

How to Work on this project:
You need a visual studio 2013 Express or equivalent or higher. Language is C#.

How to install:
There is no installer at the moment. Use VS to build and run.

About Projects within the VS Solution:
  What is OthelloAdapter:
    OthelloAdapter allows a layer of abstraction between different version clients of Othello and different version
    of Othello library. This allows re-use of the Othello library without further testing (only the adapter is solely responsible for breaks)
  In the future, we can just use an adapter to deal with different version clients without having to re-test the Othello library without it.

  What is OthelloEngineConsole:
    This is for debugging the othello engine with a barebone console mimicking the game loop.

  What is OthelloWPF
    The GUI shell to the engine. Acts as the main game windows application for users to play.
